# Maze-Solver-using-BFS-DFS-A-star
This project, done as part of the CS-540 Intro to AI course at UW Madison. The Maze Solver project is designed to solve mazes represented as a 2D grid. It includes implementations of popular search algorithms to find the shortest path between a given start position and an end position in the maze.
